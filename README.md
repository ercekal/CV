### <a name="whoami">Who Am I</a>
---

I’m a Full Stack Web Developer who is passionate about responsive Frontend frameworks. As a former Genetic Engineer, I was always interested with technology. After working in pharmaceutical corporations and running an event management company, I decided to pursue my personal dream of coding & development by enrolling <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> which is Europe's leading software development bootcamp.

During 4 months of intense training, I did pair and group programming focusing to JavaScript, Ruby, Rails and Node.js while prioritizing TDD. After finishing MA, I started working as volunteer Front End Developer in a digital agency to continue my training and development focusing to React, React Native and Front End Technologies. I can do web & mobile apps and interactive web pages with related and current frameworks with my training in full stack web development and orientation to detail. My target is to be a part of skilled and enthusiastic team that is passionate about designing and developing state-of-the-art products for the good of the people and the world. I’d like to be challenged to the borders of my knowledge and skills so that with the help of my curiosity I can find solutions to common problems.

#### Project Management & detail orientation
During the clinical trials I managed, we were using non-marketed drugs hence being audited by local and global authorities throughly. I was training the site and company staff along with investigators so that we don’t have any non-compliance and have perfect handling of possible medical adverse events. While running my event management company I was able to manage events flawlessly by coordinating different scoped teams with extreme pressure from client side with international C-Level executives of Exxon Mobil & Google Turkey.

#### Fast learning & Adaptation
During the development of MakersBnb, my team decided to use Node.js and MongoDB even though they weren’t included in our curriculum. By doing extensive research and supporting my team members, we delivered the MVP in just two days of development, and achieved version 4 two days later which included all the features we had planned for our final presentation.

#### Good Communicator
Aside from doing science related work, one of my major tasks was to act as a bridge between technical and non-technical staff.
Pairing with different people during the first half the course and working on group projects at Makers Academy, following agile principles further helped me improve as a confident communicator. I'm also mentoring 2 junior students in my course and guide them in their intense and exciting journey.
